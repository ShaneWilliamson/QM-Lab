ID4

Implemented new in ID4:
I would say the project, while still having issues is ready for use. 
	
	- There is a simple landing page which allows you to create a new file and name it. 
		- loading the page via http://cmpt371g3.usask.ca/demo/development/src/Main/ is for creating new projects only. 
		- To load an existing file, simply go to your google drive and open it from there. 
	- Share functionality is in: to share a project, click the share button, and share it exactly as you would any google drive document
		- When you've shared the file, the person you're sharing it with will see the name of the file so they can accept it.
	- There is now an extra GUI element which allows you to change the properties of a node or link. 
		Things you can change are:
		- Text
		- Text Size
		- Text Color
		- Width
		- Height
		- Color
		- IMG URL (for image nodes only)
	- Image is now custom. Input a valid URL to an image that is uploaded; no upload functionality
	- State is yellow
	- Terminal State is red... though the color may be changed by the user, so the difference is really only in the defaults
	- Branch is a diamond
	- Agent works. It is a black human body. You can place nodes on top of it, move it, and the nodes on top follow. 
		Since the body is black and "color" changes the background of the node, it's recommended to make use of coloring text and links
		However, it has the same ability as the Image to change it's display. If the user wants the agent to be a banana, the user muse 
		only change the image.      
	- Links now have an arrow for direction
	
Things for ID5 thus far:
	differentiating variables and parameters by having the circle show a p or v inside it. 
		(To use it for now, I would suggest establishing a color to differentiate them eg. blue for parameter and green for variable)

	there are several Flow improvements that need to be done
		- doubled "tubelike" line
		- adding a valve shape where the title of the link will be
		
	overhaul of how to make a link; select the type of link, click the source, click any intermediate paths, then double click on the final 
		node to end it.
