Qualitative Modelling Collaboratively

After cloning, please run **git-setup.sh**. It is located in the root of the git repository. This will set up the commit template for your new repository. 

As well, please make sure that before you begin work you refer to the set of [Git Standard Practices](https://github.com/ShaneWilliamson/QM-Lab/wiki/Git-Standard-Practices).

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ShaneWilliamson/QM-Lab/wiki) for an in-depth project description.

The wiki pages are pretty barren at the moment, so if you have something to add please do so!

<em>Happy coding!</em>
