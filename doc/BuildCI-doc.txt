Throughout the incremental deliverables the build team's experience has been great. TravisCI proved to be a challenge to overcome, but that challenge mostly lied with our first experience with headless testing.

Once we overcame that challenge using java's headless jdk and PhantomJS we were effevtively able to eliminate the greatest challenge present.

the only other challenges that we had were helping the testing team implement their tests to be automated.
